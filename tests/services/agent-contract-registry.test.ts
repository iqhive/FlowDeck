/**
 * Agent Contract Registry Tests
 *
 * Covers:
 * - Every registered contract permits `fdx-graph`
 * - The orchestrator contract no longer permits any codegraph tool
 * - Contract tool lists are asserted by VALUE, never by non-emptiness
 * - `mapper` still has no contract (known gap, recorded in TODOS.md)
 *
 * Why this file exists: the registry had no test at all, while
 * `src/services/agent-validator.ts:84` enforces
 * `contract.allowedTools.includes(ctx.toolUsed)` and `:141` escalates a
 * `tool-not-in-contract` warning to a hard block when the validator runs in
 * `strict` mode. Agent prompts instruct `fdx-graph`, so a contract that omits it
 * would deny the tool its own prompt demands. Under the default `advisory` mode
 * that failure is a warning, which is exactly the kind of thing that ships
 * unnoticed.
