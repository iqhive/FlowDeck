/**
 * Shared Prompt Fragment Tests
 *
 * Covers:
 * - TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION content is complete, asserted line-for-line
 * - Every subagent prompt embeds the whole fragment, not just its heading
 * - ORCH_CONTEXT_NOTE lands on exactly the two agents that carry it
 * - No subagent is instructed to run `fdx-graph action:build` (single writer)
 * - Graph guidance names only real actions and only the real arg names
 *
 * Why this file exists: before the fragment was extracted, the section lived
 * inlined and byte-identical in nine agent factories, and the only coverage was
 * `tests/agents/index.test.ts` asserting that a `## Token Optimization` heading
 * existed and came first. Both assertions pass on a prompt whose section body
 * has been truncated to nothing, which is how a nine-file sweep could silently
 * lose content. These tests assert the VALUES.
