/**
 * Load Rules Tool
 *
 * On-demand rule loading for agents. Allows an agent to explicitly request
 * the full content of rule modules that were not injected at startup (because
 * they are stage-restricted and the stage was not known at plugin init time).
 *
 * Usage pattern:
 *   1. At startup only always_on + language-matching rules are injected globally.
 *   2. When an agent begins work (e.g. a coder starting the execute stage),
 *      it calls this tool to load coding-style, security, and testing rules.
 *   3. The tool returns full rule content and logs which modules were loaded.
 *
 * This keeps the global instruction context minimal while ensuring agents get
 * the right guidance when they actually need it.
